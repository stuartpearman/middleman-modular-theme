We've run this tip before but a very important addition is needed:  add your phone number when you "message" your device.  We've had iPad and iPhone here that obviously were stolen - "return my device and no questions" pops up on the display - but return it to where? A disabled device becomes useless to whoever has it but you can send a message to the screen alerting whoever has it to contact the owner.

If you misplaced your iPad, how would you find it easily? Simply open Settings, then iCloud. Type in you personal Apple ID code and make sure the "Find My iPad" function is turned on. When you activate this feature, you only need to visit iCloud.com to locate a lost iPad or disable it if stolen.

find iphone
find ipad
